# Big-Sorting

Consider an array of numeric strings, unsorted, where each string is a positive number with anywhere from 1 to 10^6 digits. Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing (i.e., ascending) order of their real-world integer values and print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

**Input Format**

- The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of strings in unsorted. 
- Each of the n subsequent lines contains a string of integers describing an element of the array.

**Constraints**

- Each string is guaranteed to represent a positive integer without leading zeros.
- The total number of digits across all strings in unsorted is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).

**Output Format**

- Print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

**Sample Input**
